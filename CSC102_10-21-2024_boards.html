            My major is Embedded Systems and Robotics. This program has these six objectives:
        <h3>    <!-- ends h3 = header 3 which is a font size. -->
            <br> <!-- BREAK to add a line. -->
        <h4> <!-- Start H4 = header 4 which is a smaller font size. -->
            <ol> <!-- Ordered list start. Numbers the line items identified by <li> -->
                <li>Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that address real-world situations and challenges.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate embedded microprocessor system skills such as microcontroller selection, digital logic design, schematic creation, printed circuit board layout and construction, electromagnetic compatibility design and manufacturing design.</li>
                <li>Develop vision and sensing systems for use in robotic applications.</li>
                <li>Integrate transducers, actuators, feedback and other mechanical systems into robotic platforms.</li>
                <li>Apply examples of human and autonomous control systems into robotic platforms.</li>
                <li>Implement artificial intelligence and data systems into robotic platforms.</li>
